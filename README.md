Here’s a `README.md` file that explains the functionality of the `server.js` file and provides instructions on how to run it:

# Project Title: Job Title Clustering with Express Server

## Description:
This project processes a CSV file containing job titles and clusters the words based on predefined categories like "AI", "Cybersecurity", "Software Development", etc. After processing, it saves the results in CSV files within a `public` folder. Once the processing is completed, it starts an Express server to serve the generated CSV files and an HTML interface.

The processing scripts are executed in sequence, and the server is started only after the data processing is complete. The server serves static files (HTML, CSS, JS, and CSV files) from the `public` folder.

## Key Features:
- **CSV Data Processing**: 
  - Analyzes job titles and extracts frequent words.
  - Categorizes words into predefined clusters like AI, Software Development, etc.
  - Generates CSV files containing the processed data.
- **Express Server**: 
  - Serves the generated CSV files and an HTML file via an HTTP server.
  - The server starts only after the CSV files have been processed.

## Prerequisites:
Before running the project, ensure that you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager, comes with Node.js)

## Setup Instructions:

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the project folder):
   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-url.git
   cd your-project-folder
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   In the project directory, install the required npm packages.
   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

3. **Place your CSV file**:
   Ensure that the `title_stats.csv` file is located in the root directory of the project (the same level as `server.js`).

4. **Scripts Overview**:
   The following scripts are executed in sequence:
   - `title_stats.js`: Processes job titles and counts word frequencies.
   - `category_word_frequencies.js`: Categorizes words based on predefined categories.
   - `top_1000_words.js`: Extracts the top 1000 most frequent words.
   - `word_clustering.js`: Clusters the words into predefined categories and saves the results as CSV files.

5. **Run the Project**:
   To run the project, simply execute `server.js`. This will:
   - Run all the scripts in sequence.
   - After the scripts are completed, the Express server will start.

   You can run the server using the following command:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

6. **Access the Server**:
   Once the server is running, you can open your browser and navigate to:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

   - The server will serve the `index.html` file from the `public` folder.
   - It will also serve the generated CSV files in the `public` folder (such as `word_clustering.csv`, `top_1000_words.csv`, etc.).

## File Structure:

```
/your-project-folder
│
├── /public
│   ├── index.html       # The HTML file served by Express
│   ├── word_clustering.csv   # Generated by word_clustering.js
│   ├── top_1000_words.csv    # Generated by top_1000_words.js
│   └── (other CSV files)
│
├── title_stats.csv       # Input CSV file containing job titles
├── server.js             # Main server file (runs the scripts and starts the server)
├── title_stats.js        # Processes job titles and counts word frequencies
├── category_word_frequencies.js  # Categorizes words into clusters
├── top_1000_words.js     # Extracts the top 1000 most frequent words
├── word_clustering.js    # Clusters words into predefined categories
└── package.json          # NPM configuration file (contains dependencies)
```

## Troubleshooting:

- If you encounter any issues with file paths or missing dependencies, make sure you are in the correct directory (where `server.js` is located) and that all required files (like `title_stats.csv`) are in the right place.
- If any of the processing scripts fail, the server will not start until all the scripts finish successfully.

## Notes:
- This project assumes that the `title_stats.csv` file is properly formatted, with job titles in the third column. You may need to modify the script if your file structure is different.
- The CSV files are saved in the `public` directory, which is publicly accessible via the Express server.
